# EduWCS: An Interactive Educational Writing Correction System for Learning Chinese as a Foreign Language


EduWCS is an innovative interactive educational writing correction system designed to address the core challenges faced by learners of Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL).

## üìñ The Significance in Edutech

For learners of Chinese, mastering writing is a dual challenge of grasping complex logographic characters and intricate grammar. Traditional pedagogy often involves handwritten assignments, which are time-consuming for teachers to grade. Meanwhile, existing digital Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) tools are predominantly text-based, failing to accommodate the common and effective practice of handwriting.

**EduWCS aims to bridge this gap, acting as a link between traditional pedagogical practices and cutting-edge technology.**


## ‚ú® Key Features
We are more than just a grammar checker; we are a **learning assistant built on a pedagogical foundation**. The value of EduWCS lies in:

*   **‚úçÔ∏è Supporting Real-World Practice**: By processing images of handwritten essays directly, our system aligns with students' actual learning habits and classroom scenarios.
*   **üé® Providing Pedagogical Feedback**: The system doesn't just offer a single "correct" version. Our innovative adjustable feedback mechanism allows learners to choose their desired level of correction‚Äîfrom fixing only critical errors to comprehensive polishing. This avoids the "over-correction" issue, which can be discouraging, and facilitates a smoother learning curve.
*   **üöÄ Intuitive Visual Feedback**: Corrections are visually overlaid directly onto the original handwritten manuscript. This helps learners intuitively understand the source of their errors, reinforcing memory and promoting deeper learning.

## üì∏ System Interface
The system workflow is simple and intuitive. Users upload an image of their handwritten work, and the system automatically handles recognition, correction, and visual annotation.


### Detailed Workflow
1. **Image Pre-processing**: Use the built-in **Rotate** and **Crop** tools to easily adjust your image before correction, ensuring optimal recognition accuracy.

2.  **Upload Image**: Click the button to upload a photo of your handwritten essay.

3.  **Activate Correction**: Toggle the correction switch "on" to begin processing.

4.  **Review Interactively**:
    *   In the right-hand panel, review the categorized list of detected edits (e.g., Insertion, Deletion, Substitution).
    *   Drag the **"Edit Progress"** slider to dynamically adjust the number of corrections applied. Slide left for minimal edits; slide right for a full revision.


4.  **Locate Errors**: In the main preview area, corrections are overlaid directly onto your handwriting using highlights and strikethroughs.


5.  **Export & Save**: Export the final annotated image for future reference.
